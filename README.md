using stochastic processes and modelling for temperature pricing and volatility

# Introduction
Weather derivative pricing is a complex process that involves several financial and statistical techniques to determine the fair value of a contract whose payoff depends on weather conditions. Weather derivatives are financial instruments that businesses use to hedge against the risk of weather-related losses. These derivatives are typically based on weather indices such as temperature, precipitation, or snowfall over a specified period. A significant amount of historical weather data is analyzed to model the distribution of the underlying weather index. Our aim is to price weather options, generally looking at HDD (heating degree days) /CDD (cooling degree days) over a time period.
